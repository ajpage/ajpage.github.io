 <p>
 Despite half of the US workforce being women, this does not extend to the tech world where it is dominated by a male population. 
 Even more than this, minorities are even more underrepresented in tech. I acknowledge my white skin privilege in this regard. 
 Diversity in tech continues to create buzz but still employment demographics continue to be heavily white and male. 
 There is a lot of buzz without enough action behind it. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 To create a more inclusive industry, there has to be an active push. 
 A push to seriously recruit those people that are not included by default. 
 A push to relentlessly provide space and mentoring and accessibility. I think this has to start pre-employment. 
 Start with the youth and get them interested in tech, foster a sense of belonging and continue this to adulthood. 
 There should be more women and people of color in leadership roles so that those working for them see they have a chance 
 to grow and to belong. There are a lot of opportunities to demand inclusion, but there has to be action and not just talk.
