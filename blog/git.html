      Benefits of Using Version Control
      Using a version control application such as git allows you to track all the changes that have been made to a project. By creating "branches" multiple people can work on different (or the same) parts of a file simultaneously without overwriting each others work or affecting the base code until you are ready to merge the changes with the master file. Since all the changes of a file have been tracked it is easy to revert or compare to past versions of code and act as a backup. 
    </p>
    <p>
      How git helps to keep track of changes 
      Git is a version control system so it helps you keep track of changes using what is called a commit. A commit is a "save point" for the file that is being worked on. Each time you commit a comment can be saved with it describing the changes that have been made. This is especially helpful to see the changes when multiple people are working on the same project. 
    </p>

      Why use GitHub?
      Like git, GitHub keeps track of all the changes that are pushed to a repository. Unlike git that lives locally on your system, GitHub lives remotely and is accessible anywhere with internet availability. GitHub allows you to upload projects that are available for anyone to download and use or edit. This kind of social networking allows projects to grow.
