1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was actually quite a bit easier to wireframe with a pair than I was expecting. We used moqups and had the ability to collaborate using it which really made the process flow well. We did a good job of communicating our ideas and commenting on what the other person was doing and I think came up with a better wireframe and HTML template because of it.
2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing made creating the template really straight-forward. There was no question as to what elements we were going to need or if we were missing anything. 
3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We wanted something clean and simple with well defined sections for the header, footer, main body and a side bar.
4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about and used figure, figurecaption, and aside. I used <figure> and <figcaption> to separate out an image from the main content while keeping it in the flow and <aside> to create a side bar separate from the main page content.
