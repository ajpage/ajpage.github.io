1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Padding adds size to the element inside the border, which defines the edge of the element and margin gives a buffer zone outside the element. While they can be used similarly, they all have their own purpose.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
It can be very tricky! HTML elements are static by default so if you do not explicitly state positioning they will be static. 

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult? Styling the heading was easiest. Everything seemed to go right where I wanted it too. It was really hard not to go down the rabbit hole and keep tweaking things. I had to keep MVP in mind.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? DevTools can be really helpful especially with seeing how much area an element takes up currently.
